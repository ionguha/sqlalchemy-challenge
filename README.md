## Surfs Up! : Vacation planning using SQLAlchemy, Flask and Python ##

**_It’s summer vacation time, which means its time to smell the sea and feel the sky. And there are no better place than Hawaii where the ocean and the mountains meet, the beating heart of surfing. I decided to leave the dark confines of my office cubicle and plan a sunny, surfing vacation to Hawaii. But first, with my newly acquired skills in SQLAlchemy, I decided to do a climate analysis of the “Aloha State”_** 
 * **Climate Analysis and Exploration:** A basic analysis and exploration of “Hawaii. SQLite” database was done using     SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib.  
 * **Precipitation Analysis:** Precipitation over last one year was obtained, sorted by date and loaded into a dataframe. **_Visualization: Bar plot_**
 * **Station Analysis:** Total number of stations, most active station and observed temperature over past one year from the most active station was retrieved. **_Visualization: Histogram_**
 * **Temperature Analysis I:** Is there a meaningful difference between the average tempera-tures in June vs. December from all stations across all available years ? **_Visualization: Box Plot_**
 * **Temperature Analysis II:** Minimum, maximum and average temperatures from all sta-tions across the trip duration dates. **_Visualization: Box Plot_**
 * **Daily Rainfall Analysis:** Total precipitation and average observed temperature per weather station across the trip duration dates. **_Visualization: Line Plot_**
 * **Daily Normal:** Daily minimum, maximum and average temperatures from all stations across the trip duration dates. **_Visualization: Area Plot_**
 * **Climate App:** A Flask API was designed based on all the above queries
 * A report of the analysis is available as **_Surfs UP Report.pdf_**
